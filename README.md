# LineMaker

A collection of web-based tools for CNC pen plotting, built for my personal hobby project and 100% generated by AI.

## What's This?

I built a pen mount for my CNC machine and needed some tools to generate line art for it. Rather than spend weeks coding, I decided to experiment with AI-assisted development. This entire project is an exercise in human-AI collaboration (okay, mostly AI doing the heavy lifting while I provide coffee and feedback).

## Current Tools

### üé® HatchMaker
- **What it does**: Converts images into hatched line art suitable for pen plotting
- **Features**: 
  - CMYK channel separation for multi-color plots
  - Interactive canvas with pan/zoom
  - Drag & drop image upload
  - Configurable line patterns, spacing, and angles
  - SVG and G-code export
  - Save/load configurations
- **Status**: Working, probably has bugs

## Coming... Eventually

More tools are planned when I find time to prompt-engineer them into existence:
- **LineMaker**: Convert images to continuous line drawings
- **DotMaker**: Stippling and dot-based artwork
- **SpiralMaker**: Because spirals are cool

## Fair Warning

This is a **hobby project** with the following disclaimers:

- ü§ñ **100% AI Generated**: Every line of code came from AI assistance. I'm a developer, but I wanted to see how far I could push AI to build something useful.
- üé≤ **Quality Varies**: Some parts are surprisingly elegant, others make experienced developers weep. It's a mixed bag.
- üîÑ **Updates Maybe**: I'll update this when I feel like it or when something breaks badly enough to annoy me.
- üêõ **Bugs Expected**: Find one? Cool, open an issue. Fix one? Even cooler, send a PR.
- üìö **Learning Exercise**: This project is as much about learning to work with AI tools as it is about pen plotting.

## Live Demo

üåê **Try it online**: [https://the-nils.github.io/LineMaker/](https://the-nils.github.io/LineMaker/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Click on HatchMaker
4. Upload an image
5. Fiddle with settings until it looks good
6. Export SVG or G-code
7. Send to your CNC/plotter
8. Watch it draw things

No build process, no dependencies, no npm hell. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript doing their thing.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're:
- A human who found a bug
- A human who wants to add features
- An AI that gained sentience and wants to improve its own work
- Someone who just wants to make the code less embarrassing

Feel free to open issues or PRs. I can't promise quick responses, but I do read everything.

## Technical Notes

- **Framework**: Vanilla JS (because why complicate things?)
- **Architecture**: "It works on my machine" driven development
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual clicking and hoping
- **Documentation**: The code IS the documentation (good luck)

## License

MIT License - do whatever you want with this. If it breaks your CNC machine, that's between you and your machine.

## Acknowledgments

- **Claude AI**: For writing most of this code while I provided enthusiastic but often unhelpful suggestions
- **My CNC Machine**: For being patient while I figured out how to make it draw instead of cut
- **The Pen Mount**: A simple 3D printed part that started this whole adventure
- **Stack Overflow**: For existing, even though I barely used it for this project
